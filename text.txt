Install Necessary Software:
You’ll need to install specific software on your machines. For the “Master” machine, install “Java,” “Jenkins,” “Ansible,” “Docker,” and “Python.” On both slave machines, install “Java” and “Docker.”
Create three instances named “Master,” “Slave1,” and “Slave2” in your AWS EC2 console.
Configure the instances with the appropriate AMIs, instance types, security groups, and key pairs.
Git Workflow:
Implement a Git workflow for version control. Ensure that developers follow best practices, such as feature branches, pull requests, and code reviews.
CodeBuild Automation:
Set up CodeBuild to automatically trigger builds when commits are made to the master or develop branch.
For master branch commits:
Build the code.
Test it.
Push to production if tests pass.
For develop branch commits:
Build the code.
Test it.
Do not push to production.
Containerize with Docker:
Create a Dockerfile for your application.
Build the Docker image every time there’s a push to GitHub.
Use the pre-built container “hshar/webapp.”
Ensure that your code resides in the ‘/var/www/html’ directory within the container.
Jenkins Pipeline:
Define a Jenkins Pipeline with the following jobs:
Job1: Build (for building the code)
Job2: Test (for testing the product)
Job3: Prod (for pushing to production if applicable)
